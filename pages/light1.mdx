This is the first in a series of tutorials about the mathematical underpinnings of light transport. This tutorial covers, among other things:

* The derivation of the radiative transport differential equation.
* The corresponding Lagrangian stochastic $$Q$$-process.
* Scattering statistics and mean-free path.

> This tutorial is aimed at students at the graduate level or advanced undergraduates.

## The Photon

Let's first start by thinking about the simplest object involved in light transfer: the photon. If you're interested in what a photon actually is - an excitation of a quantum field - you'll have to learn quantum field theory, but for our purposes, imagine that a photon is just a discrete particle of light travelling through space. A photon has a few elementary properties, including:

* **Position**: At any given time $$t$$, every photon has a position $$X_t \in \mathbb{R}^3$$.

* **Direction**: At any given time $$t$$, every photon has a direction $$\omega_t \in \mathbb{S}^2$$ (here $$\mathbb{S}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$$ denotes the 2-sphere of points unit $$\ell_2$$ distance away from the origin). While direction may vary, the speed of a photon in free space is always constant as $$c \approx 3 \cdot 10^8 \, m/s$$.

* **Wavelength**: A photon has a specific wavelength $$\lambda>0$$. The electromagnetic field carrying a photon usually has a periodicity and $$\lambda$$ is the length of a single period.

* **Frequency**: A photon has a frequency $$\nu$$. The frequency measures the time periodicity at which the underlying electromagnetic field - locally, the oscillations of electromagnetic field returns to its original configuration every $$1/\nu$$ seconds. The frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of the photon,

$$
\begin{equation}
\lambda \nu = c \,.
\end{equation}
$$

* **Energy**: A photon carries with it a certain amount of energy. This energy comes from the light source that generate the photon via spontaneous or stimulated emission. The Planck-Einstein relation postulates that the energy a photon carries is directly porpotional to its frequency. The constant of porportionality is called the Planck constant $$h$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
E = h \nu \,.
\end{equation}
$$

* **Momentum**: As postulated by de Broglie, the momentum $$p$$ of a particle is inversely porpotional to its wavelength, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{h}{\nu} = \frac{E}{c} \,.
\end{equation}
$$

For our purposes the important parts of a photon are really only its position, direction, and wavelength. In the coming sections, we will therefore focus on $$(X_t,\omega_t,\lambda)$$.

## Photon Motion in Free Space

Photons don't just sit there, they tend to move around. In fact, they move around at the speed of light (which is pretty fast). Therefore, if we're describing the motion of a single photon $$(X_t,\omega_t,\lambda)$$ in free space, it should satisfy the basic equation of motion:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d X_t}{dt} = c \, \omega_t \,.
\end{equation} 
$$

In linear optics, photons tend not to interact with each other, so if we have a collection of photons $$(X_t^{(i)},\omega_t^{(i)},\lambda^{(i)})$$, the equations are motions are not coupled in any way:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dX_t^{(i)}}{dt} = c \, \omega_t^{(i)} \,. 
\end{equation}
$$

Note that to complete the equations, we need to specify the directions $$\omega_t^{(i)}$$. In free space, once a photon has been released, it will retain its direction and speed as long as it doesn't hit anything. Therefore, the free space equations for photon motion are exceedingly simple, as the directions $$\omega_t^{(i)}$$ are all constants $$\omega^{(i)}$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dX_t^{(i)}}{dt} = c \, \omega^{(i)} \,. 
\end{equation}
$$

Starting from initial positions $$X_0^{(i)}$$, these ODEs are very easy to solve:

$$
\begin{equation}
X_t^{(i)} = X_0^{(i)} + c ω^{(i)} t.
\end{equation}
$$

Note that this analysis is in terms of individual non-interacting particles $$X_t^{(i)}$$. This is usually refered to as a Lagrangian formulation. Most of the time however, the motion of individual particles is not the end goal. Instead, we are often interested the distribution of particles $$\rho_t$$. This distribution $$\rho_t(x, \omega)$$ is specified as a function of both a position in space $$x \in \mathbb{R}^3$$ and a direction $$\omega \in \mathbb{S}^2$$. Note that the evolution of $$\rho_t(x,ω)$$ is not tied to the viewpoint of the individual particles, but rather to the viewpoint of individual locations in free space. This distribution-based view is referred to as an Eulerian formulation.

How does one go from the Lagrangian formulation to an Eulerian formulation? One way is via a technique known as characteristic analysis. Note that the equations of motion are completely reversible - if I specify the position and orientation of a photon at time $$t$$, you can calculate backwards the position and orientation at time $$0$$. Therefore, all particles follow non-intersecting characteristic paths $$(X_t, \omega_t)$$ through the phase space $$\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^2$$. This means that the distribution of particles along these paths should remain constant over time. This gives the equation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho_t(X_t, \omega_t)}{dt} = 0\,.
\end{equation}
$$

Using the chain rule,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\rho_t(X_t, \omega_t)}{dt} = \nabla \rho_t(X_t, \omega_t) \cdot \frac{dX_t}{dt} + \frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial \omega_t} (X_t, \omega_t) \cdot \frac{d\omega_t}{dt} + \frac{\partial \rho_t(X_t, \omega_t)}{\partial t} = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
$$

In the particular case of free space, $$\omega_t$$ is constant, therefore, using the equation (6) for $$dX_t/dt$$ from above, we get

$$
\begin{equation}
c \omega \cdot \nabla \rho_t(x, \omega) + \frac{\partial \rho_t(x, \omega)}{\partial t} = 0\,.
\end{equation}
$$

Rearranged this gives

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho_t(x, \omega)}{\partial t}  = - c \omega \cdot \nabla \rho_t(x, \omega) \,.
\end{equation}
$$

If we fix $$\omega$$, you might recognize this as the transport equation from partial differential equations.

## Scattering in Homogenous Media

![scattering](/physics/light/scattering.jpeg)

Of course, the above equations are very simplistic. They simply say that photons move in straight lines when in free space. Though this is useful, often-times photons are moving through a medium where they constantly collide with other particles and are scattered and absorbed throughout. The different ways materials scatter light are wholy reasonable for the different ways they look. For example, in the above figure, light enters the lion and then scatters around inside it until it exists and hits the viewer's eye. This gives the impression of soft lighting and partial translucency (see how the tail lets some light through with its red-orange highlights). So, if we are going to talk about light transport with an eye towards rendering things like the statue above, we are going to need to discuss how light changes direction.

Unfortunately, this process is not deterministic. Or at least, it is not deterministic from the macroscopic viewpoint. Two light particles can hit the same surface and be reflected in completely different directions. We model this by saying that a light particle hitting a material (or fluid) at location $$x$$ in direction $$\omega_i$$ has a certain probability of being redirected in direction ωoωo​. It also has a certain probability of being absorbed. In the most general case, we want to think about rates rather than concrete probabilities. When a photon enters a scattering medium like the one pictured above, the photon will move a certain distance until it impacts something in the medium that redirects it. You should think of the contents of the medium as being random, and hence the distance travelled before a photon impacts an obstacle will be random as well. The average distance travelled before a photon hits an obstacle (i.e. scatters) is called the *mean free path*. The higher the mean free path, the more the photon can travel through the medium unobstructed and therefore the clearer the medium.

Let us take this information and think about the parameters of a particle $$(X_t,\omega_t)$$ travels through a homogenous scattering medium. Occasionally $$\omega_t$$ will suddenly change randomly when the particle hits something. But how do we characterize this randomness?

We can model this scattering process by using a continuous $$Q$$-process on the sphere $$\mathbb{S}^2$$. Recall that a $$Q$$-process $$W_t$$ on $$\mathbb{S}^2$$ is a continous time random process whose value changes abruptly at random times $$T_1,T_2,...,T_n,...$$. In particular, a $$Q$$-process on $$\mathbb{S}^2$$ is characterized by a generator operator $$\mathcal{L}$$ which satisfies

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\omega_i, \omega_o)= \sigma(\omega_i, \omega_o) - \mu_s (\omega_i) \delta(\omega_i, \omega_o) \,,
\end{equation} 
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu_s(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \sigma(\omega, \omega_o) \, d\Omega(\omega_o) \,.
\end{equation}
$$

Here $d\Omega$ denotes the surface area measure on $\mathbb{S}^2$. We'll talk more about $$\mathcal{L}$$ later, but for now, let's focus on $$\sigma(\omega_i,\omega_o)$$. You should think of the function $$\sigma(\omega_i,\omega_o)$$ as the probability transition rates to go from a state $$x \rightarrow y$$. That is, $$W_t$$ satisfies:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}(W_t + dt \in d\Omega(ω_o) \mid W_t = \omega_i) = \sigma(\omega_i, \omega_o) \, d\Omega \, dt + o(dt)\,.
\end{equation}
$$

In other words, after a very small amount of time $$dt$$, $$W_t$$ has a probability of about $$\sigma(\omega_i,\omega_o) \, d\Omega dt$$ to jump to a small solid angle $$d\Omega$$ around $$\omega_o$$. This function $$\sigma(\omega_i,\omega_o)$$ is called the phase function and determines the rate at which a photon travelling in direction $$\omega_i$$ is redirected to direction $$\omega_o$$ after it hits an obstacle.

How do we go from a Lagrangian formulation of a $$Q$$-process to an Eulerian formulation? Well let us ignore the position of our particles (the medium is homogenous, so position doesn't really matter when it comes to rotation) and simply examine the probability distribution of the directions $$\omega^{(i)}$$ of our particles. We write the distribution of directions of our particles as $$\rho_t(\omega)$$. You should think of this function as a representing the fact that there are $$\rho_t(\omega)$$ photons anywhere in the medium that are in direction $$\omega$$.

Let us compute how the density $$\rho_t(\omega)$$ changes over time at a given orientation $$\omega$$. From the definition of the $$Q$$-process above, we have that

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho_{t+dt}(\omega) &= \rho_t(\omega) + \left[\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \rho_t(\omega_i)\sigma(\omega_i, \omega)\, d\Omega(\omega_i)\right]dt \\
&\quad - \left[\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \rho_t(\omega) \sigma(\omega, \omega_o) \, d\Omega(ω_o)\right] \, dt + o(dt) \,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

This expression is saying that the number of particles in direction $$\omega$$ at time $$t+dt$$ is the number of particles in direction $$\omega$$ at time $$t$$, plus the number of particles that are redirected from any other direction $$\omega_i$$ into direction $$\omega$$ over the time $$dt$$, minus the number of particles that are redirected from direction $$\omega$$ to any other direction $$\omega_o$$ over the time $$dt$$. Note that we can take $$\rho_t(\omega)$$ out of the integral above to get

$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_{t+dt}(\omega)=\rho_t(\omega)+\left[\int_{\mathbb{S}^2}\rho_t(\omega_i)\sigma(\omega_i,\omega)\, d\Omega(\omega_i)\right] \, dt - \mu_s(\omega)\rho_t(\omega)\, dt+o(dt) \,.
\end{equation}
$$

Rearranging the above and taking $$dt\rightarrow0$$ gives us

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial t}(\omega)= \int_{\mathbb{S}^2}\rho_t(\omega_i) \, \sigma(\omega_i,\omega)\, d \Omega(\omega_i) - \mu_s(\omega) \rho_t(\omega) \,.
\end{equation}
$$

This often appreviated by writing

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho_t}{\partial t} = \mathcal{L}^*\rho_t \,,
\end{equation}
$$

where $$\mathcal{L}^*$$ is the adjoint of $$\mathcal{L}$$ (i.e., $$\mathcal{L}^*(\omega_i, \omega_o) = \mathcal{L}(\omega_o, \omega_i)$$). This equation is called the forward equation for a $$Q$$-process. Here, one says that the operator $$\mathcal{L}^*$$ generates the time evolution of $$\rho_t$$​. This is very similar to deriving the forward equations for a random walk by using Ito's lemma.
