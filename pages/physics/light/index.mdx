# Light Transport

![image](/physics/light/Hand.jpg)

This is the first in a series of tutorials about the mathematical underpinnings of offline and real-time physically based rendering. This tutorial covers, among other things:

* The derivation of the radiative transport differential equation.
* The corresponding Lagrangian stochastic $$Q$$-process.
* Scattering statistics and mean-free path.

> This tutorial is aimed at students at the graduate level or advanced undergraduates.
